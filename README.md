### EcmaScript 6 parser written in Rust

>> Ideas and implementation details are taken from various other JavaScript
parsers, such as acorn-js, esprima and Microsoft TypeScript.

Work in progress, 50% of tokenizer done.

Parser is EcmaScript 3, 5, 6 compatible.

This parser would not be possible without acorn-js. Huge thanks to @marijnh for doing the hardest part.
